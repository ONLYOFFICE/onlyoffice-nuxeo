## Installing ONLYOFFICE Docs

You’ll need a running instance of ONLYOFFICE Docs (Document Server) that can communicate both ways with your Nuxeo server and is reachable by end-user browsers.

#### ☁️ Option 1: ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud
No installation needed — just [register here](https://www.onlyoffice.com/docs-registration) and get instant access.
Your registration email includes all required connection details, including the **Document Server address** and **JWT credentials**.

#### 🏠 Option 2: Self-hosted ONLYOFFICE Docs
Install ONLYOFFICE Docs on your own infrastructure for full control.
You have two main choices for the ONLYOFFICE Document Server:

* **Community Edition (Free)**: Ideal for small teams and personal use.
  * The **recommended** installation method is [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer).
  * To install it on Debian, Ubuntu, or other derivatives, click [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx).
* **Enterprise Edition**: Packed with professional features and scalability for larger organizations. To install, click [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/enterprise).

Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition comparison can be found [here](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

> **Note:**  Document Server ↔ Nuxeo must be mutually reachable. The Document Server must be able to **POST** to Nuxeo (callback flow).

## Installing the addon package 📥

You have two options:

### Option A: Nuxeo Marketplace (recommended)
Install directly from [Nuxeo Marketplace](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace)

### Option B: [nuxeoctl](https://doc.nuxeo.com/nxdoc/installing-a-new-package-on-your-instance/)

```
nuxeoctl mp-install /path/to/onlyoffice-nuxeo-package-x.x.zip
```

## Configuring the addon package ⚙️

Open the [nuxeo.conf](https://doc.nuxeo.com/nxdoc/configuration-parameters-index-nuxeoconf/) file and enter the name of the server with ONLYOFFICE Docs installed:

```
onlyoffice.url=http://documentserver/
```
where the **documentserver** is the name of the server with **ONLYOFFICE Docs** installed.
The address must be accessible from the user browser and from the Nuxeo server.
The Nuxeo server address must also be accessible from **ONLYOFFICE Docs** for correct work.

JWT is used to restrict access to ONLYOFFICE Docs and to guarantee data integrity.
To enable it, set the shared secret key by adding the `onlyoffice.security.key=yoursecret` line to the **nuxeo.conf** file.
In the ONLYOFFICE Docs [config file](https://api.onlyoffice.com/docs/docs-api/additional-api/signature/), specify the same secret key and enable the validation.
If your Document Server expects a non-default JWT header or prefix, override `onlyoffice.security.header` (default `Authorization`) and `onlyoffice.security.prefix` (default `Bearer `).

## Compiling the ONLYOFFICE addon package for Nuxeo

To build Nuxeo package, the following steps must be performed for Ubuntu:

1. The stable Java version is necessary for the successful build. If you do not have it installed, use the following commands to install Open JDK 8:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
    ```

2. Install latest Maven:
Installation process is described [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

3. Download the ONLYOFFICE addon package for Nuxeo source code:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/onlyoffice/onlyoffice-nuxeo.git
    ```

4. Compile ONLYOFFICE addon package for Nuxeo:
    ```bash
    cd onlyoffice-nuxeo/
    mvn clean install
    ```

5. Built package is located here `./onlyoffice-nuxeo-package/target/onlyoffice-nuxeo-package-x.x.zip`

## How it works ✍️

**Create a new file**

1. Open the target workspace/folder.
2. Click Create new (ONLYOFFICE icon).
3. Choose Document / Spreadsheet / Presentation, name it, and confirm.
4. The editor opens — start working immediately.

**Open an existing file**

1. Locate your file in *Nuxeo*.
2. Click **Open with ONLYOFFICE** (or the editor icon).
3. The file opens in the embedded editor for viewing or editing (per your permissions).

**Auto-save & versioning**: Changes are sent back to Nuxeo; Nuxeo handles repository updates/versioning.

The ONLYOFFICE integration follows the API documented [here](https://api.onlyoffice.com/docs/docs-api/get-started/basic-concepts/).

## ToDo / Known limitations

- **Save-to-Nuxeo latency:** changes are pushed to Nuxeo only when the editing
  session ends (ONLYOFFICE callback status 2, sent by the Document Server after
  the last user closes the editor, plus an internal delay — up to ~1 min). There
  is no intermediate save while a document is open.
- **Forcesave not wired up:** faster/periodic saves require ONLYOFFICE *forcesave*
  (callback status 6). It is currently a no-op — `CallbackServiceImpl` does not
  override `handlerForcesave`, so any forcesave is silently dropped. To enable it:
  1. Implement `handlerForcesave` in
     `onlyoffice-nuxeo-core/.../sdk/service/callback/CallbackServiceImpl.java`
     (write the blob like `handlerSave`, but keep the lock and skip creating a
     version each time).
  2. Trigger it via a manual Save button (`onlyoffice.customization.forcesave=true`
     in `nuxeo.conf`) and/or Document Server `autoAssembly` (`local.json`:
     `services.CoAuthoring.autoAssembly.enable=true`, `autoAssembly.interval`).
